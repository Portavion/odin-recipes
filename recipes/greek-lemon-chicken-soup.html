    <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>This delicious Greek lemon chicken soup (avgolemono) is whipped up in less than 20 minutes, making it the perfect weeknight meal.</p>
        
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        
    <ul>
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <li>4 cloves of garlic, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1-2 lemons</li>
        <li>1 carrots, peeled and chopped into cubes</li>
        <li>300g roast chicken</li>
        <li>200g white rice, rinsed thoroughly</li>
        <li>Handful of fresh dill, half finely chopped / half reserved for garnish</li>
        <li>3 eggs, whisked</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil or chicken fat</li>
        <li>1.4 litres chicken stock</li>
        <li>Optional 1/4 teaspoons turmeric for colour</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Start by adding the chicken fat or oil, onion and garlic into a large/deep frying pan. Season generously with salt and pepper and fry over a medium/low heat for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>After this time, add the garlic and the zest of one lemon. Gently fry for a further 2 minutes, then add the chicken stock, rice and optional turmeric for colour.</li>
        <li>Stir to combine then reduce the heat to a low simmer for 10-12 minutes, or until the rice is tender. Add the chicken when it is the final minute of cooking time. Meanwhile, whisk the eggs in a mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Once the rice is tender, turn off the heat and add the juice of Â½ to 1 lemon (depending on preference) and the finely chopped dill. Stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Slowly add two ladles of the soup into the egg mix whilst continuously stirring. This will temper the eggs and prevent them from scrambling. Once combined, stir the egg mix into the pan and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Serve the soup with a crack of black pepper, a sprinkle of dill and a lemon wedge. Dive in!</li>
    </ol>
